# CIPSA App

## About

- This is a quick app I created for a friend who wanted a form that was accessible on the internet.
- They wanted the form data to be written to a Google Sheet, in a specific format, if the user submitting the form entered a specific name and password.
- Access to the Google Sheet is provided via a service account.

## Technologies

I decided to build this with NextJS v15 and React v19 to learn more about:

- NextJS's app router
- React Server Functions and Form Actions
- React Compiler and how it integrates with React Devtools

## Getting Started

- Clone the repo.
- Install the modules: `npm install`
- Run the server: `npm run dev`
- Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
